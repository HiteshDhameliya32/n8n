ðŸš€ Automating Knowledge Base Creation with n8n + Pinecone + Google Gemini

I recently built a workflow in n8n that takes care of one of the most tedious tasks in AI projects: preparing and structuring data for vector databases.

Hereâ€™s what it does ðŸ‘‡
âœ… Pulls files directly from Google Drive
âœ… Downloads and processes them automatically
âœ… Splits large documents into smaller, context-friendly chunks
âœ… Generates embeddings using Google Gemini
âœ… Stores everything in a Pinecone vector database

This means that any new document I add to my Drive folder can be instantly transformed into structured embeddingsâ€”ready for search, analysis, or any downstream AI application. No manual preprocessing, no extra scripts.

ðŸ”‘ The big win?
I can now continuously grow my knowledge base just by dropping files into Google Drive. n8n handles the rest.

This setup is a game-changer for anyone working with:

Research repositories ðŸ“š

Internal knowledge bases ðŸ“‚

Content archives ðŸ“°

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: scaling this workflow to handle larger datasets and monitoring for real-time updates.

Have you tried automating your data-to-vector pipeline yet?
