💬 Built My Own RAG Chatbot with n8n + Pinecone + Google Gemini

One of the most exciting parts of working with AI is turning raw knowledge into conversational experiences.
I recently created a workflow in n8n that powers a retrieval-augmented chatbot — and it works beautifully!

Here’s how it comes together 👇
✅ A chat trigger captures user messages in real time
✅ The query is transformed into embeddings with Google Gemini
✅ Relevant context is pulled from a Pinecone vector database
✅ The response is generated using Google Gemini Chat
✅ A simple memory module keeps the conversation flowing naturally

The result?
A chatbot that doesn’t just “guess” answers — it can actually retrieve and reason over real knowledge sources.

🔑 Why this matters:

Teams can interact with their own documents in natural language

Customer support can become context-aware instantly

Any knowledge base becomes conversational without heavy coding

This workflow makes it incredibly easy to plug RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) into real-world use cases.
