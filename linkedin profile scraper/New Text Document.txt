🚀 Built a Smart LinkedIn Profile Finder — powered by AI + n8n!

Ever wished you could find exactly the right LinkedIn profiles based on role, industry, and location — automatically?
I just built a workflow that does exactly that 👇

⚙️ How it works:
1️⃣ You enter any role + company/industry + location (like “Head of Growth | Fintech | Mumbai”)
2️⃣ The workflow searches LinkedIn profiles via Google and scrapes key info like:

👤 Name

💼 Position & Company

🌍 Location

🔗 Direct LinkedIn URL

🧠 Snippet or description
3️⃣ It then neatly exports everything to Google Sheets for easy access & sharing.

💡 This means you can build curated lists of:

Potential leads for outreach

Industry experts for interviews

Hiring prospects for your startup

Or even build your own mini “LinkedIn data assistant”

And the best part — it runs hands-free using n8n + custom JS logic for pagination, filtering, and cleanup.

🔥 Next step: Automating profile enrichment (company, contact info, domain links) to make it a full lead-gen powerhouse.

Would you like me to share the step-by-step setup or a ready-to-use workflow JSON? 🤔
