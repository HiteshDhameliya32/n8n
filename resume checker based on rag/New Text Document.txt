🚀 Automating Resume Intelligence with AI + n8n

I just built a new workflow that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) inside n8n to automatically analyze and evaluate resumes! 🧠📄

Instead of manually scanning through candidate profiles, this workflow:
✅ Extracts resume text automatically
✅ Uses RAG to match candidate skills with hiring criteria
✅ Generates structured insights like:
 • Candidate summary
 • Skill match scores
 • Recommendations
 • Hiring decision suggestions
✅ Even flags profiles that need a human review before final selection.

This automation combines n8n, vector databases (like Pinecone), and AI reasoning — turning the hiring process into a data-driven, intelligent workflow.

I built it as part of my ongoing experiments to blend AI, RAG, and workflow automation into real-world, practical tools for teams.

💡 Imagine an HR system that doesn’t just read resumes… it understands them.

Would you be interested if I open-sourced this workflow or made a tutorial series on how to build your own RAG-powered hiring assistant? 👇
