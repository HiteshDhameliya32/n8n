🚀 Introducing My Automated Resume Manager – Powered by n8n + RAG

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been building something that solves a real productivity and hiring bottleneck.
I’m excited to share an automation workflow that identifies potential candidates and schedules interviews — in ONE click.

🧠 How it works
🔹 Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to scan resumes and extract relevant skills & experience
🔹 Automatically matches profiles with the job requirements to identify high-potential candidates
🔹 Sends personalized interview emails directly from the workflow
🔹 Checks availability + books calendar slots instantly
🔹 Final result: you always know who is shortlisted and when the interview is scheduled

💼 Why this matters
Recruiters and hiring teams spend hours manually filtering resumes, sending emails, and coordinating time slots.
This workflow reduces that effort from hours → minutes while improving accuracy and candidate experience.

⚙️ Tech Stack
✔ n8n
✔ RAG-based resume intelligence
✔ Email automation
✔ Calendar scheduling (Google / Outlook supported)
