1️⃣ Problem Statement

Many businesses, sales teams, and agencies struggle to find qualified local leads efficiently. They can query Google APIs, but:

Raw data (places, phone numbers, addresses) is hard to act on.

Manual filtering, scoring, or enrichment is time-consuming.

Integrating data into outreach systems or CRMs requires technical know-how.

Essentially: Businesses have access to data but lack actionable lead-ready output.

2️⃣ Target Audience

The workflow is most useful for:

Lead generation agencies that need bulk local business leads.

Local marketing or sales teams trying to identify prospects by category, location, or rating.

Franchise consultants / real estate consultants seeking high-value businesses in specific areas.

Small businesses / startups trying to find partners, collaborators, or customers in a region.

3️⃣ Hook (Why They Must Care)

“Stop wasting hours manually searching Google Maps — get ready-to-use leads with phone, website, address, and type automatically compiled.”

“Turn scattered API data into actionable insights for outreach or marketing — no coding required.”

“Save time, reduce errors, and increase sales efficiency by automating lead discovery.”

4️⃣ Solution (What Your Current Workflow Does)

Fetches businesses/places data from Google Places API.

Stores structured output in Google Sheets.

Optional: Can enrich with additional metadata (region code, session token, ratings).

Effect:

Produces ready-to-use lead lists.

Centralizes data for outreach or analysis.

Automates repetitive data collection tasks.
